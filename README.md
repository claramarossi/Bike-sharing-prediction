Machine learning project

# Course
"Machine Learning" course - first year of Master degree. Its goal is to explain advanced ML techniques (such as SVM, Random Forest, kernel-based learning, NN), understanding the theoretical foundations of each them and acquiring the know-how to successfully apply them to solving practical problems. 

# Project
This study focuses on the use of advanced machine learning techniques (K-means, h-clust, PAM, KNN, SVM, NN, RF, and XGB) to predict the hourly demand for bicycles, with the goal of improving the quality and efficiency of the service and reducing wait times for users. The chosen dataset contains rental data from the city of Seoul over a period of approximately one year and includes various weather-related variables.
